First our code inputs the name of the user, then it inputs the users age. If the age is under 21 is states that they are not allowed to drink and if they are over 21 it states that they are allowed to drink. Our code makes it easier to find out if someone is able to drink alcohol or not in the United States of America.

Why we used this specific Code of Conduct: We thought that the code of conduct we found on several other GitHub repositories covered all the factors of fostering a positive environment for contributors to the open-source project.

Why we used this specific LICENSE.md: The MIT License seemed to be the best option because it allowed free access for public use with only a year warranty, and allowed whoever uses it to edit it and change it to their specific needs.
